udp-server.c is a normal sink. It receives messages and sends it back,
if SERVER_REPLY == 1 in proj-conf.h.


udp-client-WHITE-SENDTO-SPECIFIC.c has lc==WHITE, plus it sends messages.
Right now, it can succesfully send to the sink. If you change the receiver's IP, it should be able to send messages to other nodes.

udp-client-RED-MSG-RECEIVER.c is suppose to receive messages and send them
back, if variable SERVER_REPLY == 1. The code is copied from the sink.
